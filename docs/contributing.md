# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the framework! A few guidelines:

- Follow the existing repository style and keep code small and testable.
- Add or update headless tests in `tests/` and ensure `make test` stays green.
- If changing public module APIs, update the docs in `docs/` and add examples.
- For large changes, open a PR with a short description and rationale.

Local workflow:
- Run `make test` before opening a PR
- Keep commits focused and small
